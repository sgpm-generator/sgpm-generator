The Singapore Gurkha Photography Museum project is an attempt to record and catalogue the stories from and surrounding the history of Singapore Gurkha Contingent. The project is primarily an archive of photographs (which are artefacts in themselves) or photographs taken of artefacts of note that will help us piece together their time spent in Singapore.
